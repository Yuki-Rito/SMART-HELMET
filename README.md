# SMART-HELMET


This is a paragraph about a smart helmet project that I worked on from March 2023 to May 2023. The smart helmet is an IoT device that can detect various situations that may endanger the rider, such as accidents, alcohol consumption, or improper helmet wearing. The smart helmet can also send SMS alerts to the rider's friends and family members in case of emergency. The smart helmet uses RFID tags to provide security and prevent theft. Additionally, the smart helmet has a temperature sensor that can monitor the heat level and prevent short circuits.

The hardware components that I used for this project are:

- Arduino Uno: a microcontroller board that controls the logic and communication of the smart helmet.
- Mems sensor: a motion sensor that can detect the acceleration and orientation of the helmet.
- Grove (gas detection): a sensor module that can measure the alcohol level in the rider's breath.
- Zigbee transceiver: a wireless module that can communicate with other Zigbee devices, such as the RFID reader.
- GSM module: a cellular module that can send and receive SMS messages.
- Step down transformer: a device that can reduce the voltage from the battery to the Arduino board.
- Full bridge rectifier: a device that can convert AC current to DC current.
- IR sensor: a sensor that can detect the presence of an object near the helmet, such as the rider's head.
- Temperature sensor: a sensor that can measure the temperature of the helmet.

The software tools that I used for this project are:

- Arduino IDE: an integrated development environment that allows me to write and upload code to the Arduino board.
- Embedded C: a programming language that I used to write the code for the smart helmet.
